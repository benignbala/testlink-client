# testlink-client
This projects is a Groovy wrapper over the popular testlink-java-api. The output of this project will be a jar file
which can be used to add Test Suites, Test Plans, Test Cases, Builds etc. to a Test Project in the testlink. This relieds
totally on the testlink-java-api. So, a big thanks to that team.
